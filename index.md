        <h2>Welcome to the World of Go</h2>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>Go, also known as Weiqi or Baduk, is an ancient board game that originated in China more than 4,000 years ago. It is considered one of the four essential arts of Chinese culture, alongside calligraphy, painting, and playing the guqin.</p>
            
            <p>The game is played on a 19×19 grid of lines, where players alternately place black and white stones on the intersections. The objective is to control territory by surrounding empty areas of the board and capturing the opponent's stones.</p>

            <p>Go is not just a game; it's a reflection of life itself. Each stone placed represents a decision, each move a commitment to a path forward. The interplay between local battles and global strategy mirrors the balance we seek in our daily lives.</p>
            
            <p>The ancient Chinese believed that Go represented the macrocosm of the universe. The black and white stones symbolize the eternal struggle between opposing forces - yin and yang, light and dark, creation and destruction.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #654321;">Modern Renaissance</h3>
            <p>In recent years, Go has experienced a renaissance thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The historic matches between AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol brought global attention to this ancient game, demonstrating both the beauty of human intuition and the power of machine learning.</p>
            
            <p>Today, Go continues to attract players of all ages who seek not just entertainment, but a path to deeper understanding of strategy, patience, and the elegant complexity that emerges from simple rules.</p>
